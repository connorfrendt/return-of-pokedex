## Lab

Nothing should be a jaring change. Any UI change should be transitioned in. 

- Add a staggaring list transition that hides pokemon as the user types in a name (using transition-group)
- Add a detail view for when you click on a specific pokemon and use `<transition>` to show it. (modal might be fun)
- Refactor / clean up some of the JavaScript code.  
- Refactor your CSS to use PostCSS using `scope`
  
Bonus / Stetch:
- Add a shuffle button that randomizes the order of the displayed pokemon
